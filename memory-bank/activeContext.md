# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is currently focused on refining the dark mode implementation, container padding responsiveness, and ensuring consistent styling across the application.

### Recent Changes

#### 1. Container Configuration

- Updated container padding strategy:
  - No padding on mobile for full-width experience
  - 1rem padding from tablet (md) breakpoint up
  - Centered by default
- Applied to all container instances across components

#### 2. Dark Mode Implementation

- Updated PrimeVue configuration for dark mode support
- Implemented dark mode toggle in header
- Enhanced dark theme colors and contrast:
  - Base: #1a2426
  - Surface variations: #212e30, #1a2426, #151d1f
  - Text: #f2f2f2 (primary), #26393B (secondary)
  - Improved shadow contrast with primary color tint
  - Better border visibility in dark mode
- Integrated with Tailwind and PrimeVue theming

#### 3. Component Updates

- Gallery component with full-screen mode
- Search filters with enhanced dark mode support
- Hotel details page with responsive layout
- Contact form integration

### Active Decisions

#### 1. Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with container padding strategy
- Consistent spacing across breakpoints
- Full-width mobile experience
- Comfortable reading width on larger screens

#### 2. Theming

- Maintaining brand green (#354f52) as primary color
- Dark mode colors chosen to complement primary green
- Enhanced surface hierarchy for better contrast
- Text contrast optimized for accessibility
- Consistent shadow treatment with theme-aware opacity

#### 3. Component Architecture

- Using PrimeVue components for consistent UI
- Custom components for specific features
- Shared composables for common logic
- Type-safe props and events

### Current Challenges

#### 1. Dark Mode

- Ensuring consistent dark mode across all components
- Optimizing color contrast for accessibility
- Smooth transitions between themes
- State persistence across sessions
- Shadow and border visibility in dark mode

#### 2. Performance

- Image optimization for gallery
- Lazy loading implementation
- Component code splitting
- Cache management

### Next Steps

#### 1. Immediate Tasks

- [ ] Verify container padding across all views
- [ ] Test dark mode across all components
- [ ] Verify color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [ ] Implement smooth theme transitions
- [ ] Add loading states for async operations

#### 2. Upcoming Features

- [ ] Enhanced gallery navigation
- [ ] Advanced search filters
- [ ] Multilingual content expansion
- [ ] SEO optimization
